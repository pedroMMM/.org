## We believe brilliant minds deserve safe bodies.

[Founded by Kris NÃ³va](/stories/founders-statement/) in 2021 with nothing more than a **broken heart**, **hope**, and a **linux server** in **San Francisco, California**.

Our dream is to enable **gender confirming healthcare**, **financial resources**, and **overall support** for transgender minds in **STEM**.

We believe that a **brilliant mind** should never be held back by their body.
